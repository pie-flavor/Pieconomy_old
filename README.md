# Pieconomy

## Warning: DOES NOT WORK! (Pending implementation of the Inventory API)

This is an inventory-based economy plugin. Currencies are defined in `currencies.conf`, where they are used in `items.conf` to assign monetary values to items. These items are used as money, in a full implementation of the Economy API.
#### Developers:
This API does not support contextual actions or virtual accounts.

### Configuration
See the generated configuration files for details.

### Commands
`/bal [player] [currency]`: Checks the current balance of the player (defaults to the person executing the command) for the specified currency (defaults to the default currency).

`/pay <player> <amount> [currency]`: Pays another player the specified amount of the specified currency (defaults to the default currency).

`/value [item]`: Gets how much money an item is worth.

All economy commands from other plugins will work as well.

Note that in none of these commands does the player specified by the command have to be online. Also note that since accounts are inventories, if a player's inventory can't store any more, the transaction will fail.

### Changelog
1.0.0: First "release".
1.0.1: Fixed a HOCON whoopsie in the autogenerated files.
1.1.0: Added the `/value` command.
